# Imgurgeeks-extensions

A modern Chrome extension written in es6 that creates a new page on imgur.com and gathers statistics on a user's posts and images.

It includes a useful example on how to fully replace a webpage with one generated by the chrome extension *without* generating script errors or loading any of the original page's external css/js references.
